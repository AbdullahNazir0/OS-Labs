// There are n philosophers sitting at a circular table. Each philosopher alternates between thinking and eating. They need two forks to eat, but each fork is shared between two adjacent philosophers. THe challenge is to design a solution where:
// 1. Philosophers do not starve(each philosopher must get a chance to eat).
// 2. There is fair resouce allocation - philosophers must not get preferential access to forks(i.e. no philosopher can monoplize the forks).
// 3. Philosophers pick up the fork in such a way that deadlock is prevented.
